# Git
Version control (sometimes referred to as source control) plays an important role in any development project, including test automation. It is the practice of tracking and providing control over changes made in the source code. And since one of the most common tools used in version control is Git, let’s get to understand some of the most common Git commands.

### Benefits of Git
1. It’s free (and open-source): You can freely contribute to the code any time and, of course, you don’t need to purchase it, since it is open-source.
2. Performance: It is faster and more reliable than any other version control software as it focuses only on file content rather than on file names.
3. Security: Git protects the code and the change history through a cryptographically secure hashing algorithm, called SHA1.
4. Widely-used: Git has become the preferred VCS tool in many great organizations.
